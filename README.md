Prediction of 10 year risk of CHD using multiple algorithms and Ensemble Learning 


Machine Learning can play a crucial role in predicting the existence or absence of locomotor disorders,
cardiovasculariidiseases, and other conditions. Such information, if foreseen far in
advance, can provide crucial insights to clinicians, who can then tailor their diagnosis
and treatment to each individual patient. This research intends to construct a model that

predicts the prevalence of cardiovascular disease easily, usingiimeasurable health-
related variables by smartwatch users. In this paper the data corresponding to the health-
related data variables provided by smartwatch are selected from the Framingham Heart

Study and the aim is to classify the target variable to (disease\non disease) using
different machine learning algorithms and to find which algorithm is suitable for this
dataset.

The dataset is accessible to the public on the Kaggle website and comes from an ongoing
cardiovascular research of Framingham, Massachusetts people. The objective of
classification is to determine whether a patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary
heart disease (CHD). The dataset contains information on patients. It has more than
4,000 records and fifteen qualities. Variables Each characteristic is a possible risk factor.
There are both demographic and behavioral risk factors, as well as medical ones.

Attributes:


Demographic:


• Sex: male or female (Nominal)


• Age: the patient's age; (Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been
truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)


• Education: no other information given
Behavioural:


• Current Smoker: if the patient is a current smoker or not (Nominal)


• Cigarettes Each Day: the average number of cigarettes smoked by a person per
day.
(may be deemed continuous because one may smoke any number of cigarettes,
including a half-cigarette.)
Details on medical history:


• Blood Pressure Medicine: whether or not the patient was using blood pressure
medication (Nominal)


• Whether or whether the patient has previously experienced a stroke (Nominal)


• Whether or whether the patient was hypertensive, prevalence of hypertension
(Nominal)


• Diabetes: whether the patient had diabetes or not (Nominal)
Details about your current medical condition:


• Tot Total cholesterol concentration (Continuous)


• Systolic blood pressure (Sys BP) (Continuous)


• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)


• Body Mass Index (BMI): (Continuous)


• Rate of the Heart: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as
heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large
number of possible values.)


• Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)
Target variable for forecasting:


• 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) - (1 indicates "Yes", 0 indicates
"No")
