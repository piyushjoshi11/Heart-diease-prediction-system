Prediction of 10 year risk of CHD using multiple algorithms and Ensemble Learning 


Machine Learning can play a crucial role in predicting the existence or absence of locomotor disorders,
cardiovasculariidiseases, and other conditions. Such information, if foreseen far in
advance, can provide crucial insights to clinicians, who can then tailor their diagnosis
and treatment to each individual patient. This research intends to construct a model that

predicts the prevalence of cardiovascular disease easily, usingiimeasurable health-
related variables by smartwatch users. In this paper the data corresponding to the health-
related data variables provided by smartwatch are selected from the Framingham Heart

Study and the aim is to classify the target variable to (disease\non disease) using
different machine learning algorithms and to find which algorithm is suitable for this
dataset.
